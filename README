MultiMarkdown XHTML Typography Stylesheet for HTML export and preview

Version: 0.1

Based on the IE6 Universal Stylesheet by Andy Clark (http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/) - 99% of the code starts from there.

WHAT?

This comes from a need I had. I write in MultiMarkdown (https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown) with a live preview of what I'm writing.

To use this style for the output, just put at the beginning of your text the following metadata:

CSS: style.css

Make sure that the .css file is named "style.css" (or change its name and the metadata) and it's located in the same folder of your markdown file.

It should work out of the box.
